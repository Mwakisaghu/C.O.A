- double-entry. This means that for every debit entry, there must be a corresponding credit entry of the same value
- accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)

### Double Entry

- Assets Accounts (Debits Increase, Credits Decrease)
- Liabilities (Debits - decrease, Credit - increase)
- Equity Accounts (Credits Increase, Debits Decrease)
- Revenue Accounts (Credits Increase, Debits Decrease)
Debit (Left Side): Represents a decrease in equity (owner's investment).
Credit (Right Side): Represents an increase in equity (owner's investment) or the distribution of profits to owners.
- Expense Accounts (Debits Increase, Credits Decrease)
Debit (Left Side): Represents an increase in expenses or the incurring of expenses.
Credit (Right Side): Represents a decrease in expenses.

### Relationship with BC
- Recording Transactions:
BC -you enter transactions such as sales, purchases, expenses, etc., directly into the system.
Transactions are typically recorded using various modules, like Sales, Purchases, and General Journal Entries.
Posting to General Ledger (Ledger Entries):

- Posting to General Ledger (Ledger Entries):
Transactions => create "ledger entries" which affect various accounts.
These entries are automatically posted to the General Ledger, impacting accounts in accordance with the transaction's debits and credits.

- Preparing Financial Statements:
BC - has built-in functionality to generate financial statements like the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.
It pulls data from the General Ledger to create these statements, reflecting your company's financial position and performance.

- T-Accounts and Account Balancing:
No traditional T-accounts in BC => the software handles all debit and credit entries behind the scenes.
Balancing accounts is done automatically as transactions are posted, adhering to the double-entry accounting principle.

- Chart of Accounts in Business Central:
a structured list of all the accounts used in your company's financial records.
Each account is assigned a unique account number, a name, and a type (asset, liability, equity, revenue, expense).
This setup allows Business Central to categorize transactions correctly and generate accurate financial reports.
